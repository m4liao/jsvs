# jsPsych Solutions for Vision Sciences
Sample code for adapting jsPsych for visual attention experiments.

ACVS-adapted, imagesExp, and test-prototype are in jsPsych version 6, and templateExperiment is in version 7.1. There are minute differences, but nothing substantial. Please refer to our preprint (https://psyarxiv.com/gqf2m/) to understand our code.
